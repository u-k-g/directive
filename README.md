# directive

<summary><strong>overview</strong></summary>

`directive` is an app where you explain your goal, it makes a personalized roadmap with you, then gives you five dead simple tasks every day to get you to your goal.

<summary><strong>who this is for</strong></summary>

<summary><strong>how it works</strong></summary>

1. **tell us your goal** – what do you want to achieve?
2. **answer a few questions** – we ask 3-4 strategic questions to understand your situation
3. **review your roadmap** – we create concrete milestones (you can edit them)
4. **get tasks for the day** – receive 5 actionable tasks focused on your first milestone
5. **take action** – complete tasks, track progress, repeat

no vague advice like "network more" or "learn fundamentals" – every task is something you can actually do today.

<summary><strong>the problem we solve</strong></summary>

most goal-setting apps give you either:
- vague advice that sounds helpful but isn't actionable
- complex systems that require more planning than doing

directive cuts through this. it's designed for people who know what they want but are paralyzed by not knowing where to start.

<summary><strong>why directive works</strong></summary>

**focuses on the next step, not the whole journey**
- no overwhelming roadmaps
- tasks you can complete in one day
- immediate action over endless planning

**asks the right questions**
- understands your actual situation
- focuses on practical experience
- avoids academic background noise

**stays concrete**
- "build a portfolio website" not "master core principles"
- "apply to 3 specific companies" not "improve networking"
- "record a 2-minute demo video" not "enhance presentation skills"
